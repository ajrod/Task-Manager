Task-Manager
============

This is an app I wrote for myself in first year when I was obsessing over time management. I Have been using it for assignments and other deadlines ever since. The app allows for creating tasks that need to be done in an organized list. The list can then be filtered with tags that are assigned to each task or other critera such as day, week or month. It allows for a simple way to at a glance to look at what needs to be done and manage your time accordingly.
