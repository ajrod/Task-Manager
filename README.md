Task-Manager
============

This is an app I wrote for myself in first year when I was obsessing over time management. 
I Have been using it for assignments and other deadlines ever since. 
It has become a ritual adding all my deadlines at the beginning of a semester and watching as I gradually checked them
all off!

The app allows for creating tasks in an organized list. 
The list can be filtered with categories/tags that are assigned to each task or other critera such as day, week or month. 
It allows for a simple way to, at a glance look at what needs to be done and manage your time accordingly.

You can setup tasks to send you reminders, or just check the status of a task by putting your cursor over it.
When a task is complete check it off or delete it.
